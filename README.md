# :1234: On-Screen Calculator Project  

This project is part of **The Odin Project's** curriculum, where I combined everything I’ve learned so far to build a fully functional on-screen calculator! 🚀  

## 💡 Consolidated Knowledge  

- ✨ Writing dynamic, interactive logic with **JavaScript**.  
- 🎨 Aligning items in diverse layouts using **CSS**.  
- 🛠️ Structuring the interface with clean and semantic **HTML**.  

## 🎯 Features  

- ➕ Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).  
- 🔄 A clear button to reset everything.  
- 📟 A dynamic display that updates with inputs and results.  

This project strengthened my problem-solving, logic implementation, and user interface design skills.
